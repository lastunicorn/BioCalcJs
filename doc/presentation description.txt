The BioCalc application - Through the dark waters of the javascript inheritance
 - Inheritance mechanism
 - Duck typing

Starting from the architecture of a small application that I developped in the last two months, I want to discuss the inheritance mechanism in javascript: what can be done, what cannot be done, what are the differences compared to C# or Java.

Advancing further into the darkness of the BioCalc application, I will talk about "Duck typing". In javascript you don't check the type of the object, instead you check if the object has the methods you wanna call.
